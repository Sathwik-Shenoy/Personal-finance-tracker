## Resume Formatting Tips

1. **Use bullet points** starting with action verbs (Developed, Implemented, Built, Achieved)
2. **Include specific numbers** and metrics wherever possible
3. **Highlight technologies** in bold or at the end of each point
4. **Focus on business impact** and quantifiable results
5. **Use ATS-friendly keywords** from job descriptions you're targeting
6. **Keep descriptions concise** but comprehensive (2-3 lines per bullet point)

## Suggested Resume Order
1. **Personal Finance Tracker** (most comprehensive, recent)
2. **Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning** (research/ML focus)
3. **Movie Recommendation System** (ML/data science)
